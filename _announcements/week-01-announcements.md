title: Welcome to EECS C106B/206B!
---

We're extremely excited to have you! It's going to be a great semester. We've spent a lot of time revamping the content, and we hope you will gain a lot out of this advanced robotics course. 106B/206B really pushes the envelope by diving into open research problems. This class is on the cutting edge of the field, building off the foundation established by 106A/206A.

## About the Course

This course is an introduction to research in model-based robotics. It focuses on dynamics and control of robot manipulators, mobile robotics, grasping and manipulation, and soft robotics. 

The course is a sequel to EECS C106A/Bioengineering C106A and EECS C206A which covers the mathematical fundamentals of robotics including kinematics and dynamics. This course will delve deeper into several areas of robotics which are currently of research interest. Concepts will include manipulator dynamics and control, nonholonomic steering of mobile robots, path planning, grasp modeling with friction, grasp planning, and soft robotics.

## Logistics

This course will be taught in a seminar style, with homework, presentations, four small projects, and a final
project. **All submissions will go through Gradescope (Course Entry Code: M45XDR)**. A piazza page has been created for students to discuss homeworks and projects. Note that there will be no exams in this course. 

Questions regarding **homeworks** should be directed to **Valmik**, **Amay** and **Jun**. Questions regarding projects should be directed to any TA. Questions regarding **course logistics** should be directed to **Tiffany**. All questions can and should be directed to **Piazza** for the fastest response. When emailing a GSI, please prefix the subject line with **[EECS 106B]**.

## Prerequisites

Students are expected to have taken EECS C106A / BioE C106A / EECS C206A, which should be sufficient preparation for all material in this class. A strong programming background, knowledge of Python and Matlab, and some coursework in feedback controls (such as EE C128 / ME C134) are also useful. Students who have not taken EECS C106A / BioE C106A / EECS C206A should have a strong programming background, knowledge of Python and Matlab, and exposure to upper division linear algebra, Lagrangian dynamics, mechatronics, and feedback controls. This course will also be drawing from other disciplines including but not limited to optimization (EECS 127), nonlinear systems theory (EE 222 / ME 237), and continuum mechanics (ME 185).

## Resources

The required text is Richard Murray, Zexiang Li and S. Shankar Sastry's *A Mathematical Introduction to Robotic Manipulation* (first edition digitally available <a href="http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/mlswiki/?title=First_edition">here</a>). 

Other material will be drawn from:
- *Nonlinear Systems: Analysis, Stability, and Control* by S. Shankar Sastry
- *Feedback Systems: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers* by Karl J. Astrom and Richard M. Murray.
- and numerous research papers

## Disability Accommodations & Emergencies

If you need disability-related accommodations in this class, if you have emergency medical information you wish to share with us, or if you need special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please inform us immediately. Please see the professor or GSIs privately after class or send us an email.

## Grade Breakdown

|Final Project| 30%|

Three feedback surveys will be posted, each worth an extra 0.25% of your grade. An additional extra 0.25% will be granted for completing the end-of-semester university feedback.

## Homeworks

Homeworks will be collected and graded using the Gradescope system. Create an account on gradescope.com with your Berkeley email account and SID. Add this course with the code **M45XDR**.

Each student is allocated **5 total days of extension**, to be used on any homework assignment with no loss of points. To allow for homework solutions to be released in a timely manner, **no more than 2 extension days may be used on a single assignment.** If you have used up all of your slip days you may still turn in homework up to 2 days late however turning it in 1 day late will result in half credit and 2 days late will result in quarter credit. We will try to allocate slip days in a way to maximize your overall points.  

Collaboration on homework sets is encouraged, but all students must write up their own solution set. Additionally, every student is accountable for the solutions they submit and may be asked to discuss them with a GSI or instructor. **Please list all collaborators at the top of each submitted homework set.**

## Scribing
Each student will need to scribe for one lecture for the semester. A LaTex template can be found in the Resources tab under Scribing. Students will need to sign up for scribing and submit their notes to Gradescope. Scribing notes are due by midnight the day after the lecture you scribed for. When submitting to Gradescope, please zip together the pdf and the .tex files to submit both of them.

## Paper Presentation

Each student will be responsible for presenting one paper to their lab section. This presentation should be between 15 and 25 minutes long and you will be graded based on your level of insight on the material and your ability to answer questions from course staff and other students.

## Projects

The lab in 111 Cory is open for use for the projects and the final project. **Please do not use the hardware until you have completed Lab 0**, which you will be doing in lab section on 1/23 or 1/24. The robots/hardware will be shared. 

**Each team may only reserve 3 hours at a time** and can only make a new reservation once all of the team's existing reservation times have ended. If a team is caught abusing this policy and overbooking, a **5% penalty** will be deducted from the group's project grade. Please reserve times on the following calendars:

There are no official lab checkoffs, as there are in 106A. Instead, students will work on their own time and turn in a project report to Gradescope. Projects should be completed in groups of 3, but groups of 2 are also acceptable. Slack days may **not** be used on project submissions.

## Final Project

The final project will constitute the largest single portion of your grade for this course and must include sensing, planning, and actuation components on real hardware. Whereas the 106A project was an implementation-based project, this project should be research-based. Project deliverables include a proposal, a live demo and poster session, an academic-style paper, a small website, and several intermediate check-ins. Further information will be forthcoming; in the meantime, feel free to explore the list of previous projects available on the website!
Due to the types of deliverables involved (e.g., live demonstrations), slack days may **not** be used on project deliverables, and late work will not be accepted.

## Office Hours

The instructors will hold weekly office hours to discuss lecture content, homework assignments, projects, and other course material. We will try our best to schedule them so that each student has the opportunity to attend at least one office hour each week. When discussing a current homework assignment, instructors will **not** provide solutions. Rather, instructors will be happy to help clarify fundamentals and to guide students' reasoning in related problems.

## A Note on Late Work

While  we  will  abide  by  the  policies  listed  above  regarding  specific  assignment  types,  we  understand  that unforeseen circumstances do happen.  If you feel that you will not be able to complete an assignment on time under the policies listed above due to truly extenuating circumstances, please inform a course instructor as soon as possible and **before** the associated deadline to discuss your situation. Once the deadline has passed, accommodations are unlikely.

## Regrade Requests

If you feel that your work has been graded unfairly, you may request a regrade by submitting a request on Gradescope with a written statement explaining the mistake. Be aware that points may be deducted as well as added if a regrade is requested.


## Advice 

The following tips are offered based on our experience.

**Do the homeworks!** The homeworks are explicitly designed to help you to learn the material as you go along. Although the numerical weight of the homeworks is not huge, there is usually a strong correlation between homework scores and final grades in the class.

**Keep up with lectures!** Discussion sections, labs and homeworks all touch on portions of what we discuss in lecture. Students do much better if they stay on track with the course. That will also help you keep the pace with your homework and study group.

**Take part in discussion sections!** Discussion sections are not auxiliary lectures. They are an opportunity for interactive learning. The success of a discussion section depends largely on the willingness of students to participate actively in it. As with office hours, the better prepared you are for the discussion, the more you are likely to benefit from it.

**Come to office hours!** We love to talk to you and do a deep dive to help you understand the material better.

**Form study groups!** As stated above, you are encouraged to form small groups (two to four people) to work together on homeworks and on understanding the class material on a regular basis. In addition to being fun, this can save you a lot of time by generating ideas quickly and preventing you from getting hung up on some point or other. Of course, it is your responsibility to ensure that you contribute actively to the group; passive listening will likely not help you much. Also recall the caveat above, that you must write up your solutions on your own. We strongly advise you to spend some time on your own thinking about each problem before you meet with your study partners; this way, you will be in a position to compare ideas with your partners, and it will get you in practice for the exams. Make sure you work through all problems yourself, and that your final write-up is your own. Some groups try to split up the problems ("you do Problem 1, I'll do Problem 2, then we'll swap notes"); not only is this a punishable violation of our collaboration policies, it also ensures you will learn a lot less from this course.
